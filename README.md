# Yuri Reality

Yuri's in control now, does she have what it takes?

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the mod up and running on your local machine for playing.

### Prerequisites

You will need the original game files for ["Doki Doki Literature Club"](ddlc.moe) on your device to play

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get the mod running

Extract an original copy of Doki Doki Literature Club.
```
Most devices have a graphical interface for extracting archives
```
Enter the folder of the extracted files
```
In this folder you should see subfolders such as game and characters
```
Copy the files from the mod into the original download of the game and overwrite when asked

```
You will be prompted to overwrite 2 folders named "lib" and "renpy". If you don't overwrite these folders, you will be unable to play
```

Once you have copied all files over you should be able to play!
